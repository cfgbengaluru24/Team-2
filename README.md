## Problem Statement
**Innovate to Conserve**: Develop a comprehensive solution to automate the identification, removal, use, and monitoring of the restoration process in the Shola forests.

We created an innovative solution to aid The Shola Trust in conserving the Shola forests. Our solution includes:

1. **Smart Analysis System**: 
   - Utilizes advanced algorithms for land identification.
   - Automates the process of detecting areas in need of restoration.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Developed a prototype to identify lantana from images.
   - Facilitates efficient removal of invasive species.

3. **Digitalized Data Collection**:
   - Streamlined the process of collecting and managing data.
   - Ensures accurate and up-to-date information for monitoring.

4. **NGO Contact List**:
   - Compiled a comprehensive list of contacts for NGOs involved in similar conservation efforts.
   - Enhances collaboration and information sharing.
